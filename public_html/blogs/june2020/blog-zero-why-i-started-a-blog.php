                So this is my first official blog post of this website! I have to admit that setting up the basics of this web server was a lot more complicated than I anticipated, but here we are!

                On this site, I plan to post mainly about Math and Computer Science, my two great passions and also my majors. I will upload my opinions on various technologies, documentations I write while working on personal projects, and even potentially devlogs for particular projects.
              </p>
              <p>
                The primary reason I started writing about the my Math and Computer Science endeavors is to practice my communication skills. Up till now, I have worked on my technology skillsets, but not so much on communication. I realized recently that I should be able to convey my ideas in a clear and concise mannerâ€”even to people who may not be familiar with technologies I work with. Like most things, the best way to better my interpersonal skills is to practice.
              </p>
              <p>
                While that may be my main reason, I am already learning far beyond just communication skills: I learnt how to set up a server, the basics of the LAMP stack, and more. More on that on the next blog post about setting up a web server.
